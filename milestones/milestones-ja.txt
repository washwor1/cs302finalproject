To do (idea brainstorming):
get ue5 setup and figure out how to use it (both) -DONE-
make main menu
make other interfaces 
create server based multiplayer
find models to use for weapons/players
make a basic map -DONE-
figure out gun/bullet physics (shooting and recoil)
maybe add grenades and stuff too?
make player animations
make a basic campaign
implement cool easter egg
get background music
get sound effects
implement some sort of point based win condition
implement jump/falling physics
make an in-game interface for leaving games or switching teams
make bots
add zombies mode

Rubric for me: 
- All interfaces work (main menu, pause menu, submenus) [5 pts]
- you can connect to other people's games over internet [8 pts]
- there is a playable campaign with at least 1 level, objectives, and a finite ending [15 pts]
- there are at least 10 playable characters [5 pts]
- there are proper sound effects for the game [2 pts]
- teams and win conditions work properly in multiplayer [5 pts]
[BONUS]
-there is a basic bot to play against the players with at least 3 tiers of difficulty [5 pts]
