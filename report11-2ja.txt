This week I decided to move on to map making as I finished the basic tutorial last week which basically covered all I needed to know to make maps. Andy needed a basic map to test out his character modeling and bullet physics stuff, so I made a small arena with some boxes and platforms. I also played around with the creator and learned some new things about material creation. Additionally, I started watching a tutorial about how to implement c++ code into my project which will be essential in later stages when I get to making things like bots, levels, objectives, and interfaces. I then worked with andy to get the map I made previously imported into his game and to get some of his work with models and physics tested and working. This week, I plan on working towards the first draft of our multiplayer map, and if I have time, I'll probably either start adding some interface things like a health bar/ammo or I'll start working on the singleplayer map.
