Report

Andy:
For this challenge it is rather slow since both of us have never used Unreal Engine before and it's a good learning experience for us both. The physics that I am trying to go for is
trying to replicate the real world as much as possible. So the I have to do some math and then implement it into code.

Walter:
After watching the tutorial, I am trying to implement the interface and making where it function how we want it to work, but having a bit of trouble with lining it up properly and
having it be clickable.
