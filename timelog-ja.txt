Total Hours: 43.5

(10/18/21)
2 hour: set up github, wrote to-do list, decided with partner what work we wanted to do, installed UE5


(10/21/21)
2 hour: watched half of a in depth ue5 tutorial on youtube https://youtu.be/gQmiqmxJMtA

(10/22/21)
2 hour: watched the other half of the tutorial

(10/25/21)
3 Hours: Made a basic map using what I learned in the tutorial and did a lot of playing around (nanite).

(10/28/21)
1.5 Hour: Began watching another tutorial for basics of implementing c++ into unreal engine so I can have better control over certain player aspects

(10/29/21)
1.5 Hour: Watched the other half of that tutorial.

(11/1/21)
2 Hours: Worked with Andy to test some things with the player models and using the map I made

(11/4/21)
1 Hour: Drew out my layout for the main map based on shipment from COD MW. I then went and found a bunch of models online to use and saved them in my library.

(11/5/21)
2 Hours: Made the landscape for my map, the ambiance, then started laying out the major sections of my map like the borders and the giant crates.

(11/8/21)
3 Hours: Finished up my map and polished all the details like what the player can see/lighting/plants and landscape textures. I also imported a lot of assets from a 
library called quixel bridge.

(11/15/21)
3 Hours: I took a break off last week after finishing my map. Today, I made a little ball roll game based entirely in c++ in order to further develop my knowledge
of coding in c++ in the game engine.

(11/17/21)
1 Hour: Talked to andy about certain things we wanted to accomplish with the ai plus some other game related ideas for the presentation.

(11/19/21)
2 Hours: Started following this tutorial series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P12uWSFVSIc&t=1s to get some ideas on how to build my AI in c++. Finished all but the 
last video.

(11/20/21)
1 Hour: Finished the last video from yesterday. I now have an ai in pure c++ that can walk around to waypoints using the built in A* pathfinding and navmesh.

(11/24/21)
4 Hours: I really wanted to implement my own A* pathfinding instead of using the built in one so today I worked on my own implementation that could track a graph I
made by hand. Unfortunately I was not able to get this to mesh with UE's navmesh because I couldn't figure out how to interface with individual vertices in their nav
mesh, and we only have a week or so left, So I decided to give up on this route and use the built in one and maybe try my hand at my own pathfinding in a later.
project.

(11/25/21)
1 Hour: It was Thanksgiving, so I didn't have much time to actually get work done today, but I did research my options for how I could improve my AI from just a 
guy walking around with no animation to waypoints. I decided to merge my c++ code into blueprints to make development faster at this point because I was running out 
of time.

(11/27/21)
3 Hours: I began translating my code into blueprints today which went surprisingly smoothly. At the end, I had an AI that could either walk to waypoints or walk
to random points in the navigable area. I also figured out how to add animations to my skeletal mesh which was a huge improvement over the floaty t pose guy i had 
before.

(11/28/21)
4 Hours: I added a ton of functionality to my AI behavior tree which allow the AI to switch between modes of patrolling, searching, and chasing. In my chasing branch,
I also added the ability for the AI to smack you like a zombie of he gets within a certain radius of your player using a hit animation I found online. To make the 
animation, I had to do a blend on the top and bottom animations, but insert the smacking animation to the top when the AI hit you. This was to keep the ai from
just floating towards you while its top half was attacking you. 

(11/29/21) 
6 Hours: Today was the fun part: merging andy's player and menu data together with my AI and map data. After a lot of talking to him and tinkering around, I was able
to get damage and bullets to work on my AI by casting an AI in the event that a player cast failed in the hit event of a bullet. I handled the AI death by teleporting
it away and back after restoring its health. I also had to modify the way that we handled player death because originally it was built into the functionality of the 
gun, but this wouldnt work in the case of the AI, so we had to add a completely overhauled death section to the player. Then we merged both of the characters into my
map which was relatively smooth except the multiplayer crashed now for whatever reason. We kind of fixed this after ~hour of searching online by just deleting my
landscape, but this wasnt a good fix because obviously the landscape was broken. However, the guy we found the solution from said he couldnt find anything other than
this or changing the UE code so we werent really able to fix this problem. Other than these major things, I made some minor adjustments to my AI such as making it
where you have to be in a certain radius of the AI after it does the animation for damage to actually take place.
