Report

Andy:
I been working on learning to do animations by watching youtube videos (https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLL0cLF8gjBprG6487lxqSq-aEo6ZXLDLg) and being able to have the player 
shoot, but I been running into issues with finding good models for the player to hold.

Walter:
I haven't done a lot this week compared to last week as I've been working on my project 5 during my usual cs time, but I started to work on the main map for the game and I
decided on making the map a similar layout to shipment from modern warfare because it is a good small map, and I don't plan on having very many people play on it. I made the
basic landscape, found some basic models to use for like boxes and crates, and started placing them. I'm having some trouble getting the lighting to work right on some meshes, 
so I guess I will try to fix that this week as well as finishing my layout.
