To do (idea brainstorming):
get ue5 setup and figure out how to use it (both)
make main menu
make other interfaces
create server based multiplayer
find models to use for weapons/players
make a basic map
figure out gun/bullet physics (shooting and recoil)
maybe add grenades and stuff too?
make player animations
implement cool easter egg
get background music
get sound effects
implement some sort of point based win condition
implement jump/falling physics
make an in-game interface for leaving games or switching teams
