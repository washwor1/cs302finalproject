# cs 302 final project - Unreal Engine 5 First Person Shooter

This is our (Jay Ashworth and Andy Zeng) final project for cs302. The game is built on the brand new Unreal Engine 5, and features a versus multiplayer mode where you can go head to head with a friend over lan and a singleplayer "zombie-esque" mode where you can battle with a NPC AI that will keep respawning and attacking you until you die or get bored - whichever comes first.
